# TODO for Management Component Update

- [ ] Update management.css with modern color palette (gradients, softer blues/reds)
- [ ] Add subtle animations and improve shadows/borders for cleaner look
- [ ] Enhance mobile view: adjust padding, font sizes, grid gaps for better usability
- [ ] Test the component on different screen sizes (followup step)
